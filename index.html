    <p>Welcome to Denny's site! He is currently a fourth-year student at
       San Francisco State University majoring in Visual Communicatiobn Design.
       He grew up in San Francisco, California as long as he can remember. 
       The reason why he chose to study design is because he is drawn to the creative 
       process of designing, expressing his ideas through visual, and exploring a variety of different mediums.
       April Greiman inspires him because she was the first designer to embrace computer technology as a design tool, 
       which he find to be fascinating! Denny hopes to continue his education journey and graduate with a better 
       understanding of the design process and be able to apply it in the real world in his field.

       During Denny's free time, he likes to bullet journal, listen to music, and watch TV shows.
       If you are not familiar with what bullet journaling is, bullet journaling is a creative and 
       flexible method of personal organization and productivity. It involves using a blank notebook, 
       often one with dotted or grid pages, to create a system for tracking tasks, events, goals, and 
       various other aspects of your life. Bullet journaling can be as simple or as elaborate as you desire. 
       It's a versatile system that can help you stay organized, track your goals, manage your time, and express 
       your creativity all in one place. Many people find it to be a fulfilling and mindful practice that enhances 
       their productivity and organization skills.
