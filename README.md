Denny Ching Digital Time Capsule Website
# project overview
In order to document and preserve my digital encounters with various websites and
services, I made a multipage website for the project "Digital Time Capsule Website."
This website contains three distinct pages that showcase my current preferences and
usage patterns for particular apps and websites. This project also provided an exercise
for honing my HTML and CSS coding skills to produce an aesthetically appealing and
functional website. Additionally, I learned how to construct a GitHub repository for my
code to produce a shared link that allows users to view my website from an outside
server.
# technical overview
Current Status On Website: About 100% completed.
- To create my Digital Time Capsule Website, I used the Visual Studio Code
program to create my HTML and CSS for my site.
- As the website has multiple pages, three separate HTML files are created with
each having its own CSS file.
- Fonts are from Google Fonts
- I was thinking of adding a sticky navigation bar on my site so that it would be
easy for users to navigate through the other pages no matter how far down the
page you scroll.
